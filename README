This REPO contains my personal portfolio website. It displays my ability to design and style a website all on my own using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You will find a home page, about page, as well as a portfolio page. You can contact me for any questions, advice, or general comments regarding my site. My CSS page is separated by sections (the HTML code as well) in hopes that the code will be easier to understand.
